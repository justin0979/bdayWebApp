This had originally been a project from a Software Engineering class; but, I've continued to experiment on it with css animations and vanilla js to get extra practice with CSS animations and JavaScript.

        To run program, open Alt.html.
        
        To run automated version: 
        ensure your permissions have automatedProject.py 
        as executable by executing: chmod 754 automatedProject.py
        
        run with: ./automatedProject.py
        
        or with: python automatedProject.py
        
        Note: automatedProject.py has all coordinates set to a  1920 x 1080 screen 
              on Chrome at 100% zoom; however, there still may need to be adjustments
              made in this file to suit other screens. mouse-coordinates.py has the 
              code to specify where the cursor should go. This is a bit tedious; however,
              I have yet to find a method to have a cursor search out where buttons or 
              selectors are located (not sure if that even exists yet, but I'll be looking
              and experimenting).
